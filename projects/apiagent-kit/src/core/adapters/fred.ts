/**
 * FRED — the St. Louis Fed's economic time series.
 *
 * This adapter exists as much for its `info` mode as for its data, because two
 * rules in the agent's system prompt were unenforceable without it:
 *
 *   "Check whether the figure exists yet. A period that has ended is not the
 *    same as a number that has been released."
 *   "If a source exposes a vintage or a last-updated field, name it."
 *
 * `api-registry-crossref.md` §5 names both mechanisms and neither was wired:
 * `fred/release/dates` is "the temporal-feasibility gate", currently "being
 * inferred from prose"; `fred/series` metadata carries `last_updated` and
 * `realtime_start`, which "let you detect a revision rather than silently
 * forecasting against a revised vintage" — a problem §5 says the companion
 * guide raises without naming the fix.
 *
 * `info` answers both in one call by chaining three endpoints server-side
 * (series -> its release -> that release's dates), so the model never has to
 * know that "when is the next CPI print" is three hops.
 *
 * TIER. Marked A, with a standing caveat rather than a blanket claim. FRED
 * REDISTRIBUTES: CPI and unemployment are BLS figures, housing starts are
 * Census, petroleum stocks are EIA. For most forecasting questions the FRED
 * series is accepted as the number. For a question that names the issuing
 * agency's own release, FRED is a mirror and the agency is the resolution
 * source. Every result says so.
 *
 * VERIFIED LIVE 2026-09-08, all three modes. `info` on CPIAUCSL correctly
 * reported July as the newest published month with the next release due on
 * 11 September — the temporal-feasibility gate working end to end.
