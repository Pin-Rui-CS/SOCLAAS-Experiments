/**
 * The single place that knows every API exists.
 *
 * Same discipline as `projects/registry.ts` one level up, and for the same
 * reason: a hand-written array trades a remembered line for build magic, which
 * is a good trade at this size. Adding an API is one adapter file and one entry
 * here — no prompt change, no tool-schema change, because the model never sees
 * this list. It sees only what `find` returns.
 *
 * Twenty-four adapters. Twenty-two are keyless; FRED and Metaculus self-disable
 * without a key and are simply absent until one is set.
 *
 * Not all of them come from `api-registry-crossref.md`. Seven were added to
 * close domains the document does not cover at all — earthquakes, international
 * statistics, prediction markets, software releases, public attention and
 * tropical cyclones. Kalshi in particular exists because Metaculus, the
 * document's only forecasting source, closed public access after it was
 * written, which would otherwise leave that domain empty.
 *
 * Still absent and worth adding: BLS, EIA, Census, Congress.gov, CourtListener,
 * LegiScan, Regulations.gov. Each needs a free key, which is the only reason
 * they are not here.

 *
 *  - Substring matching scored `sec_edgar` for the token "rate", because "rate"

 *  - Whole-word matching then dropped `sec_edgar` from "Will Apple file an 8-K
 *    this quarter?" entirely: its keywords carry "filing" and "quarterly", and
 *    "file" and "quarter" are neither of those. A real match, lost.
 *
 * The distinction wanted is morphological. "file" and "filing" share a root;
 * "rate" and "corporate" do not — "rate" merely ends it. Stripping suffixes
 * from both sides captures that with no dictionary:
 *
 *    file, filing, filings -> fil        quarter, quarterly -> quarter
 *    rate -> rat           corporate -> corporat        (correctly apart)
